# Team Challenge \#1

Team challenges are different from individual challenges. The purpose of these is for you to pick one, or more, of your classmates and work on a project outside of class. I will reject a solution for a team challenge if you did it by yourself. Like individual challenges, I provide no guidance, and it will be difficult. It's for your and your teammates to truly challenge and grow your abilities.

For the first challenge, the requirements are simple.

1. Build a browser-based game using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

That's it. Have fun.
