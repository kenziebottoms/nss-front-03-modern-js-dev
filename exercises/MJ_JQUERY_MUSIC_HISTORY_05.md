# Music History Part 5

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires that you have completed the [Music History 4](../../3-single-page-applications/exercises/SP_JS_XHR_MUSIC_HISTORY_04.md) exercise.

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/musichistory
git checkout -b version-5
```

## Requirements

This one's simple.

Implement jQuery in your Music History code. Every `innerHTML`, `getElementById`, `getElementByClassName`, event listener and XHR request. Convert 'em all.
