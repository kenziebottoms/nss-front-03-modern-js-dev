# JQuery Slideshow

For this assignment you must use JQuery to make a slideshow.

------
### Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/rich-browser/slideshow && cd $_
```
------

## Requirements

Slideshows should have the following features:

 - Arrow buttons to navigate between images 
 - An auto-rotate feature that navigates through the images on a loop 
 - A caption for each image
 - A fade in and fade out animation
 - A consistent height and width, regardless of the size or dimensions of the images being shown 

------

### Bonus
1. Use JQuery AJAX to get your images from an external API. Try [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod) or find your own.
2. Allow the user to change the animation from fade in/out to slide in/out.
3. Have captions only appear on hover.
